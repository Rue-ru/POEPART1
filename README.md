# POEPART1
The code present is based on our Programming POE for module PROG6221. The program allows users to enter a recipe of their choice. To complete this recipe the users is first asked to indicate how many ingredients they would like to add to the recipe. The program will loop the users to add the name, quantity and unit of measurement based on the number of ingredients they would like to add. Next they are taken into the method of the recipe. Again the user will be asked how many steps they would like to add to their recipe. Once the number is indicated they will be looped to add steps until the number indicated by them is done. After all the information is add, it is all stored into an array which will give users the option to either display the entire recipe, clear the recipe and start from scratch, double the recipes quantities, half the quantities or triple the quantity.
